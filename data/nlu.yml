# Description: This NLU (Natural Language Understanding) configuration file contains the training data for
# ForestBot's language model, part of the ForestQB project. It includes examples of user intents and phrases
# that train the AI to recognize and process user requests accurately. This file is crucial for enabling
# ForestBot to understand and classify user inputs correctly, thereby facilitating effective communication
# and interaction between the chatbot and the GUI. The NLU model helps decode user intents and entities,
# which are essential for generating appropriate JSON responses that ForestQB uses to trigger specific actions.

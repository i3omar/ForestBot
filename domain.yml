# Description: This domain file defines the conversational abilities of ForestBot, part of the ForestQB project.
# It specifies the intents, entities, slots, and actions that ForestBot can recognize and execute. This setup
# enables the chatbot to interact effectively with users, processing and pushing JSON outputs that include
# intent and entity data back to ForestQB. ForestQB then processes these outputs to perform appropriate
# actions and reflect these on the GUI. This system enhances the chatbot's capability to manage and streamline
# interactions, ensuring efficient and accurate data handling and user experience enhancement.
